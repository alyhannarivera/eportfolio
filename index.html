					<p class="lead"> After passing the De La Salle University College Entrance Test, I applied for scholarship. As a result, I was granted with
						100% scholarship which covers my tuition and miscellaneous and, provides me with allowances. As a Lasallian Scholar, the drive to
						live the most of my college life is instilled in my mind. For a student who can’t afford to enroll in this prominent institution,
						I am making the best out of this opportunity. This institution trusted me; hence, I can not afford to waste all
						the things they have provided just to give an education that only a few can have. I always do my best to gain the most knowledge I
						can have. I always prefer challenging tasks because I know I can learn a lot from them. The debt I owe this institution might be the
						reason why I have the values that most people might not have. Industrious. Diligent. Goal-oriented. That is a Lasallian Scholar for you.

					<p class="lead"> After getting a scholarship, I started with my journey. On the first year, I was exposed to the different subfields 
						of Computer Science. At first, I got confused on which specialization I should take but I was then enlightened which one I am enjoying. 
						I took Software technology and accomplished a lot of projects. Most of these projects are group projects.
					</p>
					<p class="lead"> There are cases where I am the follower. On the contrary, being a leader in a group is inevitable. On my previous projects, 
						what always happens is that I will give each member a task. If a member did not report to me for so long, I will do his/her part and, 
						will end up doing everything. I am letting them be a free-loader with the belief that it is their loss since they would not learn 
						anything. However, I have realized that I am being selfish. I should push them to do their part so they could learn something.
					</p>
					<p class="lead"> Sometimes, I am on the front end. Sometimes, I am on the back end. I have experiences in User Experience, User Interface, 
						Database, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Startup Engineering.
					</p>
					<p class="lead"> Our thesis is a picture-based automatic story generator for children. It is known as Picture Books 4 and is under the 
						field of Natural Language Processing. Its significance to computing is that it can be used for further research about Story generation 
						while its significance to society is that it can teach the children how to interact properly with other people.

					<p class="lead"> At the start of my third year, I got invited to join the Ladderized program for Software Technology students. In the program, 
						one can take up some master courses while still taking up the Bachelors degree. After finishing the program, one is opt to continue on 
						their Masters degree for just one year and a term.
					</p>
					<p class="lead"> Knowing that I am a person who always wants to take on challenges, I applied for it and got in.  The program started 
						last third year-second term. There is only one course per term. This program did not cease to challenge me. Since we have been taking up 
						our Masters degree for two terms, we have a few accomplishments as of yet. On the contrary, I have already learned a lot from these 
						projects.

					<p class="lead"> During my journey, I have learned numerous programming paradigms and languages. Each of the paradigms and languages I 
						know has their own “area of expertise”; however, each of them has also their own weaknesses. C was the foundation of my knowledge. 
						Java and MySql is what I use in most of our projects. I used C# once. I can say it is pretty similar to Java. I used Prolog once for 
						our Machine Learning project and, learned Javascript for Artificial Intelligence project. I have learned Common Lisp and Python last 
						term. Compared to Python, I am more familiar with Common Lisp since we did a critique about it. As for HTML and CSS, I am currently 
						exploring both of them for our web application project namely <a href="http://juandirection.azurewebsites.net"> JuanDirection </a>.
